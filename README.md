# MBP-GPU-Upgrade

Upgrade your 2010, 2011, and 2012 MacBook Pro 15 inch (A1286) dGPU with this compact solution that fits in the DVD drive bay. 

## What is this project about?
Due to the common GPU failures and the age of them, they are no longer viable for use and may need to be replaced. Other times, you may want the latest technology to run the newest operating systems. With this upgrade, you can install an MXM Type-A GPU compatible with the Metal API. This allows you to run Metal applications and operating systems like MacOS Catalina on an older MacBook such as the MacBook Pro 2011 15 inch, which suffers from a failing built-in dGPU.
In addition, this project also includes components from another design, the [MBP-Wireless-Upgrade](https://github.com/KrutavShah/MBP-Wireless-Upgrade) allowing you to give your MacBook a WiFi and BlueTooth upgrade in addition to the GPU if you choose to.

## What is the progress so far?
Currently, this project will need a fair bit of work before it is completely ready for fabrication and use inside a MacBook. This project takes a lot of inspiration from my MXM Riser project, which will also be the basis for the design here as this project uses the MXM standard to allow the user to install a variety of GPUs.

## Why should you upgrade a MacBook that is over a decade old?
Some users may choose to hold on to a MacBook until it stops working entirely, or until a compelling new release from Apple. In any case, this project can give your old MacBook a little more life until you are finally ready to switch to something newer.  
The improvements:
- Access to Metal API on certain GPUs
- Use applications and operating systems that require newer APIs
- Install a GPU that can outperform the current dGPU.
